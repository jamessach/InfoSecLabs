This lab, "Using Encryption to Enhance Confidentiality and Integrity," is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in applying encryption techniques to secure information. The lab is part of the Fundamentals of Information Systems Security course, Fourth Edition, and authored by James Sacharanski. Students will engage in practical exercises that include generating and exchanging asymmetric encryption keys, encrypting and decrypting files using both asymmetric and symmetric methods, and employing hybrid cryptography. Additionally, students will learn to digitally sign documents and verify digital signatures using tools like GPG and Kleopatra.

The lab's primary objective is to enhance students' understanding of encryption's role in ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. By completing tasks such as capturing key fingerprints, encrypting files, and verifying signatures, students will develop a comprehensive skill set in cryptographic techniques. This experience is crucial for anyone pursuing a career in information systems security, as it provides the foundational knowledge needed to protect sensitive information against unauthorized access and tampering. The lab's structured approach ensures that students can apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios, thereby solidifying their grasp of essential security practices.
